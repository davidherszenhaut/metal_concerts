# metal_concerts
A Python script to find interesting metal concerts near me

The script works by pulling off a list of bands playing near from an [online calendar](http://www.wrekage.org/events.php).
The script then looks up each band on a [metal band database](http://www.metal-archives.com/) and returns the bands that match my particular genre choices.

Upcoming changes:
* Take the list of preferred bands and create an html page with their information
* Open up the html document automatically
