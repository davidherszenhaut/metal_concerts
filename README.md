# metal_concerts
A Python script to find interesting metal concerts near me

The script works by pulling off a list of bands playing near from an [online calendar](http://www.wrekage.org/events.php).
The script then looks up each band on a [metal band database](http://www.metal-archives.com/) and returns the bands that match my particular genre choices.

# Dependencies
* Python 3

# How to use
1. Download the `metal_concerts.py` script
2. Navigate to the directory where it was downloaded
3. Enter `python metal_concerts.py` to run the script

# Upcoming changes:
* Take the list of preferred bands and create an HTML document with their information
* Allow users to select their own genres
